# week7FinalProject

Required

- What requirements did you achieve?
  all required and one stretch (with progress to adding more)
- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
  didnt get to do as many stretch goals as I wanted, due to the project as a whole being larger than I envisioned originally
- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
  ran out of time/didnt give enough time for this large of a project
- Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
  is there a way to prevent access to specific urls to prevent other users accessing a specific users tasks (original plan, think it works somewhat but dont know if it breaks my server (used local storage))
- What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
  mdn, and the react docs
- What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
  lots of mismatches between server and client for what they were expecting
- What went really well and what could have gone better?
  styling pages was easier than I expected, likely because the pages were quite simple, coding went ok, but I think planning was my main issue. I feel I would've benefitted from something like trello to allow me to keep track of what I was working on (ironic considering the site I'm making)
